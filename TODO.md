# TODO

Practical cleanup / next steps for this repo:

1. (Done) Removed the unused Spline runtime (`runtime.js`). Re-add only if you bring back Spline embeds.
2. Replace external gist embeds with local code snippets (optional) so the site works fully offline.
3. Add a “live demo” section per framework (a minimal runnable example, not just instructions).
